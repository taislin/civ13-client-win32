# civ13-client-electron-win32
 
The is a reworked Electron client for windows to include an auto-updater to fetch the latest code from the git repository automatically.

No installs required - it's standalone. Just extract and run.

Includes version checking. Supports both locally hosted servers and the official civ13.com server.

**Note: the executable is zipped in a 7z file `(civ13-client-electron.7z)` due to the size, as GitHub limits files to 100mb.**
